# Notes

## How to change a d20 roll?

### Attack rolls

Most useful or likely:

* Lucky feat. 3x/day
* Lucky (Halfling racial trait). Always on
* Elven Accuracy feat. Turns advantage into super-advantage

Less useful or likely:
* Portent (Divination Wizard 2). Unlikely for a wizard to use this on an attack roll for themselves
* Bountiful Luck feat. Relies on having a Halfling in the party with a specific feat
